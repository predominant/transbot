Upon running, lingobot prompts for initial channels it should join.  Specify channels in one line separated by commas and a space (ie. #fedora-meeting-en, #fedora-meeting-es, #lingobot-test).  

Lingobot will translate any public channel messages, topic changes, mode changes, and users joining and leaving.  If lingobot is invited to a channel, it will auto-connect, but you must specifiy the language the channel is using immediately: "/msg lingobot <channel> <language>"
